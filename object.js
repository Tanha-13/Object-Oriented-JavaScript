// question: does javascript really have classes?
/**
 * Yes, javascript does have classes. This feature was introduced with the ECMAScript 2015 specification. Javascript is primarily a prototype-based language, and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype-based inheritance mechanisms. In other words, it provides a more familiar syntax for developers coming from class-based languages like C++, Java, but under the hood it works somewhat differently.
